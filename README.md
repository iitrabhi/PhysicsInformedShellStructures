# Physics-Informed Shell Structures

We introduce a framework to simulate the mechanical small-strain response of shell structures via PINNs.

To run the studies, simply clone this repository via
```
git clone https://github.com/jhbastek/PhysicsInformedShellStructures.git
```
and run **main.py** with the indicated study. For the strong form, simply run **main_strong.py**

For further information, please first refer to [TBD], or reach out to [Jan-Hendrik Bastek](mailto:jbastek@ethz.ch).

## Requirements

The required packages are fairly basic. Though we do not foresee any compatibility issues, we provide each version that was verified to work correctly.

- Python (tested on version 3.7.1)
- Python packages:
  - Pytorch (1.11.0 with CUDA version 11.7)
  - NumPy (1.19.2)
  - SciPy (1.5.2)
  - Matplotlib (3.3.2, only required for plotting)
